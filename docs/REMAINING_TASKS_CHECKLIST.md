- [ ] **Files:** `tests/unit/test_gates.py`, `tests/unit/test_benchmarking.py`, `pytest.ini`
- [ ] **Issue:** Stochastic optimization tests occasionally fail (1-3 flaky tests per run)
- [ ] **Current Status:** Tests pass 95-99% of the time but are not deterministic
- [ ] **Recommended Approaches:**
  1. **Fixed Seeds for Unit Tests** - Make tests deterministic with `np.random.seed(42)`
  2. **Statistical Testing** - Test success rate over multiple trials (e.g., "90% of 100 runs succeed")
  3. **Pytest Markers** - Separate fast deterministic tests from slow stochastic tests
     - Add `@pytest.mark.stochastic` and `@pytest.mark.slow` decorators
     - Fast CI: `pytest -m "not stochastic"` (~5 min)
     - Full suite: `pytest` (~30 min)
  4. **Pytest-Flaky Plugin** - Auto-retry flaky tests with `@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=3)`
  5. **Separate Test Categories**:
     - Unit tests: Fast, deterministic, run on every commit
     - Integration tests: Stochastic optimization, run nightly or on PR
     - Performance tests: Long-running benchmarks, run weekly
- [ ] **Tests Affected:**
  - `test_sdg_gate_optimization` (occasional failure)
  - `test_run_rb_experiment_with_noise` (occasional failure)
  - Other gate optimization tests (rare failures)
- [ ] **Estimated:** 4-6 hours
- [ ] **Difficulty:** Medium (requires test infrastructure refactoring)
- [ ] **Priority:** HIGH (flaky tests erode CI/CD trust and slow development)
- [ ] **Deliverables:**
  - Pytest markers configured in `pytest.ini`
  - All unit tests deterministic (fixed seeds)
  - Optional: Statistical tests for optimization success rates
