### Draft 1: Technical Focus

üöÄ **Excited to share QubitPulseOpt: Open-Source Quantum Optimal Control**

After months of development, I'm releasing QubitPulseOpt‚Äîa professional-grade framework for designing high-fidelity quantum gates using optimal control theory.

**What it does:**
‚Ä¢ Implements GRAPE and Krotov algorithms for pulse optimization
‚Ä¢ Achieves 99.9%+ gate fidelity under realistic noise (T1/T2 decoherence)
‚Ä¢ Includes comprehensive benchmarking (randomized benchmarking, filter functions)
‚Ä¢ 573+ tests, 95.8% coverage, CI/CD pipeline, NASA JPL Power-of-10 compliant

**Why it matters:**
Quantum computers need near-perfect gate operations. Even 0.1% error per gate compounds exponentially in algorithms like Shor's factorization or quantum simulation. QubitPulseOpt provides the tools to push fidelity from "pretty good" to "production-ready."

**Technical highlights:**
‚úÖ Full Lindblad master equation solver for open quantum systems
‚úÖ 8 comprehensive Jupyter notebooks covering theory ‚Üí implementation
‚úÖ Robust to amplitude noise, frequency detuning, and control field imperfections
‚úÖ Hardware-agnostic (works with superconducting qubits, ion traps, NV centers)

**From robotics to quantum:**
This project applies control theory principles I developed during autonomous drone navigation (AirHound) and NASA high-altitude imagery processing. Turns out, steering a qubit on the Bloch sphere has a lot in common with stabilizing quadrotor yaw under sensor noise‚Äîjust 10‚Å∂√ó faster!

**Open source, MIT licensed, ready for collaboration.**

### Draft 2: Impact Focus

üéØ **99.9% Fidelity Gates: Why It Matters for Quantum Computing**

I just open-sourced QubitPulseOpt, a framework that uses optimal control theory to design electromagnetic pulses for quantum gates with < 0.1% error‚Äîpushing beyond the threshold needed for practical quantum error correction.

**The Problem:**
Current quantum computers have gate errors of ~0.1-1%. To run useful algorithms (factoring, chemistry simulation, optimization), we need < 0.1% to make error correction viable.

**The Solution:**
Instead of using simple square or Gaussian pulses, QubitPulseOpt uses gradient-based optimization (GRAPE algorithm) to find pulse shapes that:
‚Ä¢ Complete gates faster (20-50 ns vs 100+ ns for adiabatic methods)
‚Ä¢ Remain robust under hardware imperfections
‚Ä¢ Minimize sensitivity to control noise

**Real-world impact:**
‚Ä¢ **NISQ devices:** Lower error rates ‚Üí longer coherent circuits
‚Ä¢ **QEC overhead:** High-fidelity gates reduce surface code distance requirements by 2-3√ó
‚Ä¢ **Algorithm development:** Reliable primitives let researchers focus on higher-level protocols

**Built with production-grade engineering:**
‚Ä¢ 573+ automated tests
‚Ä¢ CI/CD with Python 3.9-3.12 matrix testing
‚Ä¢ NASA JPL Power-of-10 coding standards (safety-critical systems)
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive documentation + 8 tutorial notebooks

**Open-source, MIT licensed. Contributions welcome!**

If you're working on quantum hardware, NISQ algorithms, or gate calibration, I'd love to connect and hear how this could support your work.

## Reddit Post (r/QuantumComputing)

**Title:** [Project] QubitPulseOpt: Open-source optimal control for high-fidelity quantum gates (GRAPE/Krotov, 99.9%+ fidelity)

**Body:**

Hey r/QuantumComputing!

I've been working on an open-source quantum optimal control framework and wanted to share it with the community. If you've ever wondered how to push gate fidelities from ~99% to >99.9%, or how composite pulses work, this might be interesting.

## What is QubitPulseOpt?

A Python framework (built on QuTiP) for designing electromagnetic pulses that drive high-fidelity single-qubit gates. It implements:

- **GRAPE** (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) - gradient-based optimization
- **Krotov method** - analytical gradient variant with better convergence
- **Composite pulses** (BB1, CORPSE, SK1) - error-suppressing sequences
- **Randomized benchmarking** - gate fidelity characterization
- **Filter function analysis** - noise susceptibility quantification

## Key Features

**Optimization:**
- Achieves F > 0.999 for X/Y/Z/H gates in ~50 GRAPE iterations
- Typical gate duration: 20-50 ns (compatible with T‚ÇÇ ~ 20-100 Œºs)
- Supports arbitrary single-qubit rotations (U(Œ∏, œÜ))

**Noise Modeling:**
- Full Lindblad master equation solver (T1/T2 decoherence)
- Control amplitude noise, frequency detuning
- Parameter sweep analysis (fidelity vs T1/T2/Œ©/Œî)

**Software Quality:**
- 573+ tests with 95.8% coverage
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- 8 comprehensive Jupyter notebooks
- NASA JPL Power-of-10 compliant (97.5% - safety-critical coding standards)

## Demo Results

From the `notebooks/05_gate_optimization.ipynb`:

```
Target: X-gate (œÄ rotation around X-axis)
Gate duration: 20 ns
Noise model: T1 = 10 Œºs, T2 = 20 Œºs

GRAPE Results:
  Initial fidelity: 0.512 (random pulse)
  Final fidelity:   0.9994
  Convergence:      48 iterations
  Infidelity:       6.0e-4 (below QEC threshold!)
```

## Why I Built This

I'm coming from a robotics/control theory background (autonomous drones, NASA HPC). I was surprised by how similar quantum control is to classical control‚Äîit's all about steering a state (Bloch sphere vs phase space) under noise constraints. This project applies those lessons to quantum systems.

## What's Next?

Planning to add:
- Multi-qubit gates (CNOT, iSWAP)
- CRAB optimization (Chopped Random Basis)
- Optimal control for continuous-variable systems (oscillators)
- Hardware integration examples (AWG pulse export)

## Questions I'd Love to Hear About

1. Are you working on gate calibration for real quantum hardware? What pulse shapes are you using?
2. What fidelities are you seeing in practice (superconducting vs ion trap vs others)?
3. Any interest in extending this to multi-qubit gates or pulse-level simulation for specific hardware?

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
‚ùì Why does this matter?

Quantum algorithms need 1000s of gates. Even 0.1% error per gate ‚Üí 90% final error after 1000 gates

To run Shor's algorithm or quantum chemistry, we need F > 0.999 (< 0.1% error per gate)

Standard pulses (square, Gaussian) typically hit F ~ 0.99. Not good enough!

## Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title:** Show HN: QubitPulseOpt ‚Äì Optimal control for 99.9%+ fidelity quantum gates

**Body:**

Hi HN!

I built QubitPulseOpt, an open-source framework for designing high-fidelity quantum gates using optimal control theory. If you're curious about quantum computing or control theory, this might be interesting.

## What problem does this solve?

Quantum computers need near-perfect gate operations (< 0.1% error) to run useful algorithms. Standard approaches (square pulses, simple Gaussians) typically get ~99% fidelity‚Äînot good enough for quantum error correction.

QubitPulseOpt uses gradient-based optimization (GRAPE algorithm) to design electromagnetic pulse shapes that achieve 99.9%+ fidelity while remaining robust to hardware imperfections (noise, detuning, etc.).

## How it works

1. Define your quantum system (Hamiltonian) and target gate (e.g., X-gate)
2. GRAPE optimizer iteratively adjusts the pulse shape to maximize fidelity
3. Simulate with realistic noise (T1/T2 decoherence via Lindblad equation)
4. Export pulse for hardware (JSON/NPZ/AWG formats)

Typical convergence: 50 iterations to F > 0.999

## Tech stack

- **Physics:** QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python) for quantum state simulation
- **Optimization:** NumPy/SciPy for gradient computation and minimization
- **Testing:** 573+ pytest tests, 95.8% coverage
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions with Python 3.9-3.12 matrix testing
- **Documentation:** 8 Jupyter notebooks covering theory ‚Üí practice

## Why I built this

Background: I come from robotics (autonomous drone navigation with noisy IMU data) and NASA HPC (latency optimization for deep learning pipelines). When I started learning about quantum control, I realized it's... the same math! Steering a qubit on the Bloch sphere is isomorphic to stabilizing a quadrotor‚Äîjust 10‚Å∂√ó faster.

This project applies classical control theory discipline (state estimation, robustness, time budgeting) to quantum systems.

## Interesting implementation details

- **Power-of-10 compliance:** Follows NASA JPL's safety-critical coding standards (97.5% compliant). No recursion, all loops bounded, 2+ assertions per function.

- **Filter function analysis:** Quantifies noise susceptibility in the frequency domain‚Äîdirectly analogous to control bandwidth in classical systems.

- **Composite pulses:** Implements BB1, CORPSE, SK1 sequences that suppress errors through geometric cancellation (similar to complementary filters in sensor fusion).

## What's next

Planning to add:
- Multi-qubit gates (CNOT optimization via gradient ascent)
- Hardware integration (pulse export for real quantum computers)
- Machine learning extensions (use RL for pulse design)
