## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. ‚úÖ Commit current status documentation
2. ‚úÖ Document git rollback analysis (decided not to rollback)
3. ‚è≥ Create GitHub issue for GRAPE pre-existing bug

### Short-term (This Week)
1. **Decision Point:** Continue with Phase 2 or skip to Phase 3?
   - **Option A:** Finish Phase 2.1 (fix assertion issues) ‚Üí 1-2 days
   - **Option B:** Skip to Phase 3 (CI integration) ‚Üí Accept current assertions
   
2. **If Option A:** Review all assertions added in commits 0c8f17e and 3503456
   - Test each module independently
   - Relax validations where appropriate
   - Target: 95% test pass rate

3. **If Option B:** Move directly to CI
   - Phase 3.1: GitHub Actions workflow
   - Phase 3.2: Add pylint, mypy
   - Phase 3.3: Pre-commit hooks

### Medium-term (Next Week)
1. Complete remaining Phase 2 or Phase 3 work
2. Address function decomposition (Phase 2.2)
3. Achieve ‚â•95% compliance score
4. Document lessons learned

## Key Decisions Needed

### Decision 1: Fix Assertions vs. Remove Them?
**Question:** Should we fix the overly strict assertions or remove them and restart?

**Recommendation:** Fix them (Option A)
- We've learned what not to do
- Only 3 tests remain failing from our changes
- Removal loses valuable validation work

### Decision 2: Function Decomposition Priority?
**Question:** Is breaking up 46 long functions critical for Task 7?

**Recommendation:** Medium priority
- Important for maintainability
- Not critical for "compliance" per se
- Could defer to Phase 4 if time-constrained

### Decision 3: CI Integration Timing?
**Question:** Should we do CI before or after finishing Phase 2?

**Recommendation:** After Phase 2
- CI should enforce a stable baseline
- Don't want CI failing due to ongoing Phase 2 work
- Once Phase 2 complete, CI locks in progress

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items ‚úÖ
- Baseline analysis (done)
- Recursion removal (done)
- Loop bounds (done)
- CI setup (straightforward)

### Medium Risk Items ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Assertion fine-tuning (may break more tests)
- Function decomposition (may introduce bugs)
- Linter integration (may reveal many issues)

### High Risk Items üî¥
- Achieving ‚â•95% compliance (significant work remains)
- Zero warnings policy (unknown scope)
- Test failures (44 remaining, causes unclear)

---

## Questions to Answer

1. **Scope:** Is 90.4% compliance "good enough" for Task 7, or must we hit 95%?
2. **Tests:** Should we fix the 44 failing tests before proceeding, or accept 92.3%?
3. **Priorities:** Is CI integration more important than assertion density?
4. **Timeline:** Do we have 1-2 weeks to complete Task 7, or is there urgency?
